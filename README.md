# OpenVista
HouseSim is an immersive Virtual Reality house exploration and building simulator that lets you easily create, import, and explore detailed 3D environments. Whether you're designing a dream home, testing lighting conditions, or simply walking through a pre-built structure, HouseSim makes it seamless and interactive.

# Features
- **Import & Build** – Effortlessly add custom 3D models or construct houses from scratch.
- **Interactive Elements** – Open doors, switch lights, and test different lighting conditions.
- **Realistic Simulation** – Move through houses and other structures as if you're really there.
- **Scenery Exploration** – Navigate not just houses but any architectural or environmental setting.
- **Offline & Privacy-Respecting** – No internet connection required, and your data stays on your device—no tracking, no third parties.
- **Completely free!** - Enjoy the full range of features without any hidden costs, subscriptions, or ads.

# Get the app
The app can be installed from the GitHub Releases page or by cloning the repository yourself and launching it in Android Studio to install it on your mobile device. Since this repository uses GitHub LFS, ensure you have Git LFS installed before cloning. You can do this by running:
```sh
git lfs install
git lfs clone https://github.com/stebinglang/OpenVista.git
```
If you've already cloned the repository normally, you can fetch the LFS files separately with:
```ssh
git lfs pull
```

# Tech Stack
- **Unity** - Primary game development engine.
- **C#** - Scripting language for game logic.
- **HTML** - Used for documentation and UI elements.​
- **Git LFS** - Manages large files within the repository.

# Contributors
A huge thank you to Sky Lu for assisting with scripting key features, including the interactive door mechanics, dynamic lighting adjustments, and precision movement controls that enhance the immersive experience of the simulation. Your contributions to both coding and testing were invaluable in refining the gameplay.

I’d also like to extend my gratitude to Ziming Xu for contributing to the 3D modeling, helping to create detailed and realistic environments that bring the virtual spaces to life. Your work added an extra layer of depth and realism to the project.
